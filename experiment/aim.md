A deterministic finite automaton (DFA) is an abstraction of a constant memory machine. A DFA either accepts or rejects a string by running through a sequence of states that are determined by the sequence of symbols in the given string. A language of a DFA is the set of all strings that are accepted by it.

This experiment is designed to help students understand this (deterministic yet) abstract model of computation through examples.
