Once you are well acquainted with the theoretical aspects of DFAs, you may head to the simulation section of this experiment. Here, you would see a deterministic finite automata, an input string, and some controls. Please follow the instructions at the top of the page to help you use the controls. You can change the DFA, change the string that is run on the DFA. This simulation helps you understand the notion of "string acceptance by a deterministic finite automaton".
