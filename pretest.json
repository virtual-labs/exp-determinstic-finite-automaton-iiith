      "question": "What is a Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA)?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "A machine with infinite states and finite alphabet",
        "b": "A finite state machine with exactly one transition for each state-symbol pair",
        "c": "A machine that can have multiple transitions from one state",
        "d": "A machine with memory to store previous computations"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. A DFA has finite states, not infinite states.",
        "b": "Correct. A DFA is a finite state machine where for each state and input symbol, there is exactly one transition to another state.",
        "c": "Incorrect. This describes a non-deterministic finite automaton (NFA), not a DFA.",
        "d": "Incorrect. DFAs are memoryless machines that don't store previous computations."

        "a": "4 components",
        "b": "5 components",
        "c": "6 components",
        "d": "7 components"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. A DFA has more than 4 components in its formal definition.",
        "b": "Correct. A DFA is formally defined as a 5-tuple (Q, Σ, δ, q₀, F) where Q is states, Σ is alphabet, δ is transition function, q₀ is start state, and F is accept states.",
        "c": "Incorrect. A DFA has exactly 5 components in its formal definition.",
        "d": "Incorrect. A DFA has fewer than 7 components (that's for Turing machines)."

      "question": "What does the transition function δ in a DFA map from and to?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "From Q to Σ",
        "b": "From Σ to Q",
        "c": "From Q × Σ to Q",
        "d": "From Q × Σ to P(Q)"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. The transition function doesn't map from states to alphabet.",
        "b": "Incorrect. The transition function doesn't map from alphabet to states.",
        "c": "Correct. The transition function δ: Q × Σ → Q maps from a state-symbol pair to exactly one next state.",
        "d": "Incorrect. This describes the transition function of an NFA, which maps to the power set of states."

      "question": "When does a DFA accept a string?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "When it processes all symbols in the string",
        "b": "When it reaches any state after processing the string",
        "c": "When it ends in an accept state after processing the entire string",
        "d": "When it visits an accept state at any point during processing"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Processing all symbols is necessary but not sufficient for acceptance.",
        "b": "Incorrect. The final state must be an accept state, not just any state.",
        "c": "Correct. A DFA accepts a string if and only if it ends in an accept state after processing the entire input string.",
        "d": "Incorrect. The DFA must end in an accept state, not just visit one during processing."

    {
      "question": "What is a regular language?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "A language with a regular pattern",
        "b": "A language recognized by some finite automaton",
        "c": "A language with finite strings only",
        "d": "A language that uses regular expressions"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. 'Regular pattern' is too vague and not the formal definition.",
        "b": "Correct. A regular language is formally defined as a language that is recognized by some finite automaton (DFA or NFA).",
        "c": "Incorrect. Regular languages can contain infinite strings.",
        "d": "Incorrect. While regular languages can be described by regular expressions, this is not the defining characteristic."
      },
      "correctAnswer": "b",
      "difficulty": "beginner"
    },
    {
      "question": "What does it mean for a DFA to 'recognize' a language?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "The DFA can generate all strings in the language",
        "b": "The DFA accepts exactly the strings that are in the language",
        "c": "The DFA can count the number of strings in the language",
        "d": "The DFA can determine if the language is finite"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. DFAs recognize languages by accepting strings, not by generating them.",
        "b": "Correct. A DFA recognizes a language L if it accepts exactly those strings that belong to L and rejects all others.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Recognition is about acceptance/rejection, not counting strings.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Recognition is about accepting strings in the language, not determining finiteness."

    {
      "question": "In a DFA state diagram, what do the arrows represent?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "The order in which states were created",
        "b": "The transitions between states based on input symbols",
        "c": "The hierarchy of states",
        "d": "The distance between states"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Arrows don't represent creation order.",
        "b": "Correct. Arrows in a DFA state diagram represent transitions from one state to another based on input symbols.",
        "c": "Incorrect. There is no hierarchy in DFA states.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Arrows don't represent physical or conceptual distance."

    {
      "question": "In a properly defined DFA, what must be true about the transition function?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "The DFA accepts the string",
        "b": "The transition function must be total (defined for all state-symbol pairs)",
        "c": "The DFA waits for the next symbol",
        "d": "The DFA returns to the start state"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. This is not about what must be true in a properly defined DFA.",
        "b": "Correct. By definition, a DFA must have a total transition function δ: Q × Σ → Q, meaning it is defined for every state-symbol pair. If not all transitions are explicitly shown in a diagram, missing transitions typically lead to an implicit reject/trap state.",
        "c": "Incorrect. DFAs process symbols sequentially and cannot wait.",
        "d": "Incorrect. There is no automatic return to the start state."

      "question": "Which of the following is a key property of DFAs?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "They have unlimited memory",
        "b": "They can solve any computational problem",
        "c": "They have constant memory (only remember the current state)",
        "d": "They can modify their transition function during execution"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. DFAs have constant memory (only the current state).",
        "b": "Incorrect. DFAs can only recognize regular languages, not solve all computational problems.",
        "c": "Correct. DFAs have constant memory - their behavior depends only on the current state and input symbol. While they can 'remember' information via their states, they don't have memory of the history or path taken to reach the current state.",
        "d": "Incorrect. The transition function is fixed and cannot be modified during execution."
